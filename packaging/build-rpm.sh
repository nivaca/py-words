# Builds py-words's RPM (and source RPM) from this checkout, into
# build/rpm/ — not ~/rpmbuild, so nothing outside the repo is touched.
#
#   packaging/build-rpm.sh [--sign[=KEY]]
#
# --sign signs both RPMs with OpenPGP, so dnf can check where they came
# from, with the project's signing key, SIGNING_KEY below (the same on all
# the author's machines; a copy of its public key is in
# packaging/RPM-GPG-KEY-py-words). --sign=KEY, or $SIGNING_KEY, names
# another key for an exceptional build. The public key is exported next to them as
# build/rpm/RPM-GPG-KEY-py-words, for people to import before installing
# (sudo rpm --import RPM-GPG-KEY-py-words). gpg asks for the key's
# passphrase as usual. Needs rpm-sign; RPMSIGN names another rpmsign.
#
# The source tarball is made from the files git knows about, committed or
# not (ignored files, such as site/ and dist/, are left out), so a change can be
# packaged before it is committed. For a release, build from a clean tree.
#
# The commit of HEAD goes into the tarball as COMMIT, for "About" and
# --version, as tools/bundle-zip.py does for the zip.
#
# Needs rpm-build, plus what the spec builds with: python3-devel and
# desktop-file-utils.
